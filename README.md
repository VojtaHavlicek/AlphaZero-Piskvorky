# Strategy.ai
This package implements a suite of reinformcement learning algorithms for board game playing. 
It contains an AlphaZero implementation that you can use to train AI for games described in games.py. 
You can then play against the models. 

## Key Features
- Abstract class for turn based games. 
- AlphaZero like reinforcement learning loop, including custom neural net definition.
- Replay Buffer for self-play game data management.
- Model Promoter for self-play model management
